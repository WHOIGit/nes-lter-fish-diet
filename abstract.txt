These data represent the diet composition of small pelagic fishes assessed by the Northeast U.S. Shelf Long-Term Ecological Research (NES-LTER) project. The six species of fish in this dataset represent a subset of the species collected in bottom trawls conducted by the NOAA Fisheries Northeast Ecosystems Surveys from Cape Hatteras to the Gulf of Maine. Sampling occurred in the Spring and Fall seasons. Fish were frozen and stomach content analyses were conducted by the Fisheries Oceanography and Larval Fish Ecology Lab at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Data are counts and length measurements for prey items examined under a dissecting microscope. Prey species were matched to the lowest taxonomic level in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) for scientific name and taxonomic serial number. The dataset was supplemented with geospatial and temporal information from NOAA Fisheries trawl databases.
